As is common in neural networks for text and natural language processing, the sentence strings are first \"tokenized\" into a list of discrete elements (words in this case). Additionally, special tokens indicating the start-of-sentence `<SOS>`  and end-of-sentence `<EOS>`  are added at the beginning and end of the sentence, respectively. The SRN requires an input at every step and thus we use `<SOS>` as the first input when the SRN is predicting the first word as output. The SRN can self-terminate a sentence by producing `<EOS>` as an output. The dict `token_to_index` maps each token to a unique integer, which is the format that the SRN actually uses as input.\n",

    "We will deviate from Elman's exact model in a few ways to make it more modern. Here is the specification we will use. \n",
    "- **Input embedding**. In Elman's original model, each word was represented by a fixed one-hot input vector. Instead, here we will learn a continuous embedding vector (size `hidden_size=20`) to represent each input word. These vectors are learnable parameters. When a word is provided as input to the SRN, it is converted to the corresponding input embedding. This layer is setup for you already in the started class, `self.embed = nn.Embedding(vocab_size,hidden_size)`\n",
    "- **Hidden layer**. This layer has length `hidden_size` and uses the **logistic** activation function. The initial vector $h_{-1}$ should be all zeros.\n",
    "- **Output layer**. This layer has length `vocab_size` and uses the **softmax** activation function. Thus, the SRN will represent an explicit probability distribution over the next token $w_j$ given the past tokens $w_1,\\dots,w_{j-1}$, through the equation $P(w_j | w_1,\\dots,w_{j-1})$\n",
    "- **Loss**. The SRN will train to maximize the log-likelihood of the target output words, e.g., we use the negative log-likelihood loss `nn.NLLLoss`. If passed a tensor representing multiple target predictions, this loss takes the mean across predictions.\n",
    "- **Optimizer**. We found reasonable results with the `AdamW` optimizer with weight decay of 0.04. Adam is like stochastic gradient descent but adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the variance of the gradient. Weight decay encourages the parameters to be close to zero leading to more stable input embeddings.\n",
    "- **Batching**. We suggest *no batching* for this simple code. Thus, the optimizer takes a step after each individual sentence. The `forward` method should process only one input word at a time. Batching produces much faster code and is recommended in practice, but it's not required here. If you want to rewrite the code to process multiple timesteps and sentences simultaneously, that's fine too."
